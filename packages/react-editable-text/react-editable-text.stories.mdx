# EditableText

A simple component that lets you modify text inline:

<Preview>
  <Story name="basic">{stories.basic()}</Story>
</Preview>

It is built to allow many types and custom styles/structures:

<Story name="types">{stories.typesGallery()}</Story>

You can also mirror the typed text somewhere else in your app:

<Story name="mirror">{stories.mirrorText()}</Story>
